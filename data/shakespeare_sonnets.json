face,\nOne on another's neck, do witness bear\nThy black is fairest in my judgment's place.\n  In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,\n  And thence this slander, as I think, proceeds.\n",

the roses,\nHang on such thorns and play as wantonly\nWhen summer's breath their masked buds discloses:\nBut, for their virtue only is their show,\nThey live unwoo'd and unrespected fade,\nDie to themselves.

spirit of love with a perpetual dullness.\nLet this sad interim like the ocean be\nWhich parts the shore, where two contracted new\nCome daily to the banks, that, when they see\nReturn of love, more

hours in me,\nThe scope and tenor of thy jealousy?\nO, no! thy love, though much, is not so great:\nIt is my love that keeps mine eye awake;\nMine own true love that doth my rest defeat,\nTo play the

devised\nWhat strained touches rhetoric can lend,\nThou truly fair wert truly sympathized\nIn true plain words by thy true-telling friend;\n  And their gross painting might be better used\n  Where cheeks need blood; in thee it is abused.\n", "Sonnet LXXXIII": "I never saw that you did painting need\nAnd therefore to your fair no painting set;\nI found, or thought I found, you did exceed\nThe barren tender of a poet's debt;\nAnd therefore have I slept in your report,\nThat you yourself being extant well might show\nHow far a modern quill doth come too short,\nSpeaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.\nThis silence for my sin you did impute,\nWhich shall be most my glory, being dumb;\nFor I impair not beauty being mute,\nWhen others would give life and bring a tomb.\n  There lives more life in one of your fair eyes\n  Than both your poets can in praise devise.\n", "Sonnet LXXXIV": "Who is it that says most? which can say more\nThan this rich praise, that you alone are you?\nIn whose confine immured is the store\nWhich should example where your equal grew.\nLean penury within that pen doth dwell\nThat to his subject lends not some small glory;\nBut he that writes of you, if he can tell\nThat you are you, so dignifies his story,\nLet him but copy what in you is writ,\nNot making worse what nature made so clear,\nAnd such a counterpart shall fame his wit,\nMaking his style admired every where.\n  You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,\n  Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.\n", "Sonnet LXXXIX": "Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,\nAnd I will comment upon that offence;\nSpeak of my lameness, and I straight will halt,\nAgainst thy reasons making no defence.\nThou canst not, love, disgrace me half so ill,\nTo set a form upon desired change,\nAs I'll myself disgrace: knowing thy will,\nI will acquaintance strangle and look strange,\nBe absent from thy walks, and in my tongue\nThy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,\nLest I, too much profane, should do it wrong\nAnd haply of our old acquaintance tell.\n  For thee against myself I'll vow debate,\n  For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.\n", "Sonnet LXXXV": "My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still,\nWhile comments of your praise, richly compiled,\nReserve their character with golden quill\nAnd precious phrase by all the Muses filed.\nI think good thoughts whilst other write good words,\nAnd like unletter'd clerk still cry 'Amen'\nTo every hymn that able spirit affords\nIn polish'd form of well-refined pen.\nHearing you praised, I say ''Tis so, 'tis true,'\nAnd to the most of praise add something more;\nBut that is in my thought, whose love to you,\nThough words come hindmost, holds his rank before.\n  Then others for the breath of words respect,\n  Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.\n", "Sonnet LXXXVI": "Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,\nBound for the prize of all too precious you,\nThat did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,\nMaking their tomb the womb wherein they grew?\nWas it his spirit, by spirits taught to write\nAbove a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?\nNo, neither he, nor his compeers by night\nGiving him aid, my verse astonished.\nHe, nor that affable familiar ghost\nWhich nightly gulls him with intelligence\nAs victors of my silence cannot boast;\nI was not sick of any fear from thence:\n  But when your countenance fill'd up his line,\n  Then lack'd I matter; that enfeebled mine.\n", "Sonnet LXXXVII": "Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,\nAnd like enough thou know'st thy estimate:\nThe charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;\nMy bonds in thee are all determinate.\nFor how do I hold thee but by thy granting?\nAnd for that riches where is my deserving?\nThe cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,\nAnd so my patent back again is swerving.\nThyself thou gavest, thy own worth then not knowing,\nOr me, to whom thou gavest it, else mistaking;\nSo thy great gift, upon misprision growing,\nComes home again, on better judgment making.\n  Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter,\n  In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.\n", "Sonnet LXXXVIII": "When thou shalt be disposed to set me light,\nAnd place my merit in the eye of scorn,\nUpon thy side against myself I'll fight,\nAnd prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn.\nWith mine own weakness being best acquainted,\nUpon thy part I can set down a story\nOf faults conceal'd, wherein I am attainted,\nThat thou in losing me shalt win much glory:\nAnd I by this will be a gainer too;\nFor bending all my loving thoughts on thee,\nThe injuries that to myself I do,\nDoing thee vantage, double-vantage me.\n  Such is my love, to thee I so belong,\n  That for thy right myself will bear all wrong.\n", "Sonnet V": "Those hours, that with gentle work did frame\nThe lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,\nWill play the tyrants to the very same\nAnd that unfair which fairly doth excel:\nFor never-resting time leads summer on\nTo hideous winter and confounds him there;\nSap cheque'd with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,\nBeauty o'ersnow'd and bareness every where:\nThen, were not summer's distillation left,\nA liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,\nBeauty's effect with beauty were bereft,\nNor it nor no remembrance what it was:\n  But

thyself to breed another thee,\nOr ten times happier, be it ten for one;\nTen times thyself were happier than thou art,\nIf ten of thine ten times refigured thee:\nThen what could death do, if thou shouldst depart,\nLeaving thee living in posterity?\n  Be not self-will'd, for thou art much too fair\n  To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.\n", "Sonnet VII": "Lo! in the orient when the gracious light\nLifts up his burning head, each under eye\nDoth homage to his new-appearing sight,\nServing with looks his sacred majesty;\nAnd having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill,\nResembling strong youth in his middle age,\nyet mortal looks adore his beauty still,\nAttending on his golden pilgrimage;\nBut when from highmost pitch, with weary car,\nLike feeble age, he reeleth from the

the true concord of well-tuned sounds,\nBy unions married, do offend thine ear,\nThey do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds\nIn singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.\nMark how one string, sweet husband to another,\nStrikes each in each by mutual ordering,\nResembling sire and child and happy mother\nWho all in one, one pleasing note do sing:\n  Whose speechless song, being many, seeming one,\n  Sings this to thee: 'thou single wilt prove none.'\n", "Sonnet X": "For shame! deny that thou bear'st love to any,\nWho for thyself art so unprovident.\nGrant, if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,\nBut that thou none lovest is most evident;\nFor thou art so possess'd with murderous hate\nThat 'gainst thyself thou stick'st not to conspire.\nSeeking that beauteous roof to ruinate\nWhich to repair should be thy chief desire.\nO, change thy thought, that I may change my mind!\nShall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?\nBe, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,\nOr to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:\n  Make thee another self, for love of me,\n  That beauty still may live in thine or thee.\n", "Sonnet XC": "Then hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now;\nNow, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,\nJoin with the spite of fortune, make me bow,\nAnd do not drop in for an after-loss:\nAh, do not, when my heart hath 'scoped this sorrow,\nCome in the rearward of a conquer'd woe;\nGive not a windy night a rainy morrow,\nTo linger out a purposed overthrow.\nIf thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,\nWhen other petty griefs have done their spite\nBut in the onset come; so shall I taste\nAt first the very worst of fortune's might,\n  And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,\n  Compared with loss of thee will not seem so.\n", "Sonnet

to peep, to gaze therein on thee;\n  Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art;\n  They draw but what they see, know not the heart.\n", "Sonnet XXIX": "When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,\nI all alone beweep my outcast state\nAnd trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries\nAnd look upon myself and curse my fate,\nWishing me like to one more rich in hope,\nFeatured like him, like him with friends possess'd,\nDesiring this man's art and that man's scope,\nWith what I most enjoy contented least;\nYet in these thoughts myself almost despising,\nHaply I think on thee, and then my state,\nLike to the lark at break of day arising\nFrom sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;\n  For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings\n  That then I scorn to change my state with kings.\n", "Sonnet XXV": "Let those who are in favour with their stars\nOf public honour and proud titles boast,\nWhilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars,\nUnlook'd for joy in that I honour most.\nGreat princes' favourites their fair leaves spread\nBut as the marigold at the sun's eye,\nAnd in themselves their pride lies buried,\nFor at a frown they in their glory die.\nThe painful warrior famoused for fight,\nAfter a thousand victories once foil'd,\nIs from the book of honour razed quite,\nAnd all the rest forgot for which he toil'd:\n  Then happy I, that love and am beloved\n  Where I may not remove nor be removed.\n", "Sonnet XXVI": "Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage\nThy merit hath my duty strongly knit,\nTo thee I send this written embassage,\nTo witness duty, not to show my wit:\nDuty so great, which wit so poor as mine\nMay make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,\nBut that I hope some good conceit of thine\nIn thy soul's thought, all naked, will bestow it;\nTill whatsoever star that guides my moving\nPoints on me graciously with fair aspect\nAnd puts apparel on my tatter'd loving,\nTo show me worthy of thy sweet respect:\n  Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee;\n  Till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me.\n", "Sonnet XXVII": "Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,\nThe dear repose for limbs with travel tired;\nBut then begins a journey in my head,\nTo work my mind, when body's work's expired:\nFor then my thoughts, from far where I abide,\nIntend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,\nAnd keep my drooping eyelids open wide,\nLooking on darkness which the blind do see\nSave that my soul's imaginary sight\nPresents thy shadow to my sightless view,\nWhich, like a jewel hung in ghastly night,\nMakes black night beauteous and her old face new.\n  Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,\n  For thee and for myself no quiet find.\n", "Sonnet XXVIII": "How can I then return in happy plight,\nThat am debarr'd the benefit of rest?\nWhen day's oppression is not eased by night,\nBut day by night, and night by day, oppress'd?\nAnd each, though enemies to either's reign,\nDo in consent shake hands to torture me;\nThe one by toil, the other to complain\nHow far I toil, still farther off from thee.\nI tell the day, to please them thou art bright\nAnd dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:\nSo flatter I the swart-complexion'd night,\nWhen sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.\nBut day doth daily draw my sorrows longer\n  And night doth nightly make grief's strength\n  \tseem stronger.\n", "Sonnet XXX": "When to the sessions of sweet silent thought\nI summon up remembrance of things past,\nI sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,\nAnd with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:\nThen can I drown an eye, unused to flow,\nFor precious friends hid in death's dateless night,\nAnd weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,\nAnd moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight:\nThen can I grieve at grievances foregone,\nAnd heavily from woe to woe tell o'er\nThe sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,\nWhich I new pay as if not paid before.\n  But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,\n  All losses are restored and sorrows end.\n", "Sonnet XXXI": "Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,\nWhich I by lacking have supposed dead,\nAnd there reigns love and all love's loving parts,\nAnd all those friends which I thought buried.\nHow many a holy and obsequious tear\nHath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye\nAs interest of the dead, which now appear\nBut things removed that hidden in thee lie!\nThou art the grave where buried love doth live,\nHung with the trophies of my lovers gone,\nWho all their parts of me to thee did give;\nThat due of many now is thine alone:\n  Their images I loved I view in thee,\n  And thou, all they, hast all the all of me.\n", "Sonnet XXXII": "If thou survive my well-contented day,\nWhen that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover,\nAnd shalt by fortune once more re-survey\nThese poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,\nCompare them with the bettering of the time,\nAnd though they be outstripp'd by every pen,\nReserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,\nExceeded by the height of happier men.\nO, then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:\n'Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age,\nA dearer birth than this his love had brought,\nTo march in ranks of better equipage:\n  But since he died and poets better prove,\n  Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love.'\n", "Sonnet XXXIII": "Full many a glorious morning have I seen\nFlatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye,\nKissing with golden face the meadows green,\nGilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;\nAnon permit the basest clouds to ride\nWith ugly rack on his celestial face,\nAnd from the forlorn world his visage hide,\nStealing unseen to west with this disgrace:\nEven so my sun one early morn did shine\nWith all triumphant splendor on my brow;\nBut out, alack! he was but one hour mine;\nThe region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.\n  Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;\n  Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth.\n", "Sonnet XXXIV": "Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,\nAnd make me travel forth without my cloak,\nTo let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,\nHiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?\n'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,\nTo dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,\nFor no man well of such a salve can speak\nThat heals the wound and cures not the disgrace:\nNor can thy shame give physic to my grief;\nThough thou repent, yet I have still the loss:\nThe offender's sorrow lends but weak relief\nTo him that bears the strong offence's cross.\n  Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,\n  And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds.\n", "Sonnet XXXIX": "O, how thy worth with manners may I sing,\nWhen thou art all the better part of me?\nWhat can mine own praise to mine own self bring?\nAnd what is 't but mine own when I praise thee?\nEven for this let us divided live,\nAnd our dear love lose name of single one,\nThat by this separation I may give\nThat due to thee which thou deservest alone.\nO absence, what a torment wouldst thou prove,\nWere it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave\nTo entertain the time with thoughts of love,\nWhich time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive,\n  And that thou teachest how to make one twain,\n  By praising him here who doth hence remain!\n", "Sonnet XXXV": "No more be grieved at that which thou hast done:\nRoses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;\nClouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,\nAnd loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.\nAll men make faults, and even I in this,\nAuthorizing thy trespass with compare,\nMyself corrupting, salving thy amiss,\nExcusing thy sins more than thy sins are;\nFor to thy sensual fault I bring in sense--\nThy adverse party is thy advocate--\nAnd 'gainst myself a lawful plea commence:\nSuch civil war is in my love and hate\n  That I an accessary needs must be\n  To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.\n", "Sonnet XXXVI": "Let me confess that we two must be twain,\nAlthough our undivided loves are one:\nSo shall those blots that do with me remain\nWithout thy help by me be borne alone.\nIn our two loves there is but one respect,\nThough in our lives a separable spite,\nWhich though it alter not love's sole effect,\nYet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.\nI may not evermore acknowledge thee,\nLest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,\nNor thou with public kindness honour me,\nUnless thou take that honour from thy name:\n  But do not so; I love thee in such sort\n  As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.\n", "Sonnet XXXVII": "As a decrepit father takes delight\nTo see his active child do deeds of youth,\nSo I, made lame by fortune's dearest spite,\nTake all my comfort of thy worth and truth.\nFor whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,\nOr any of these all, or all, or more,\nEntitled in thy parts do crowned sit,\nI make my love engrafted to this store:\nSo then I am not lame, poor, nor despised,\nWhilst that this shadow doth such substance give\nThat I in thy abundance am sufficed\nAnd by a part of all thy glory live.\n  Look, what is best, that best I wish in thee:\n  This wish I have; then ten times happy me!\n", "Sonnet XXXVIII": "How can my Muse want subject to invent,\nWhile thou dost breathe, that pour'st into my verse\nThine own sweet argument, too excellent\nFor every vulgar paper to rehearse?\nO, give thyself the thanks, if aught in me\nWorthy perusal stand against thy sight;\nFor who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,\nWhen thou thyself dost give invention light?\nBe thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth\nThan those old nine which rhymers invocate;\nAnd he that calls on thee, let him bring forth\nEternal numbers to outlive long date.\n  If my slight Muse do please these curious days,\n  The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.\n"}
